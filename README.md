# OfficeHourProject

This app was designed for TA's and professors in the CS department to host personalized office hours. Users can register as a student or instructor (instructors must be verified before allowed to create courses) for a particular university. Students can join classes and the instructor can choose to promote them to a TA. TAs can set and modify their hours on the class calendar and personalize their "classroom" with draggable widgets such as video call, text chat, whiteboard, and code editor. TAs can choose to set up a queue for their classroom in order to let in students one at a time or set up a password. All users can edit their account information (name, password, etc) and their publicly displayed profile info (bio, profile pic, profile design, etc). Instructors can delete classes and students can drop classes.
